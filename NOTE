ASP.NET CORE House Keeping

Steps to create .net core empty web application. 

dotnet new webapp -o aspnetcoreapp
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
cd aspnetcoreapp
dotnet run

Middleware
This determines how our application run and in what order. e.g.
User makes a request, 
server queues the request in application pool
IIS w3wp.exe worker process manages request/response

The flow is as follows
Begin Reuest - Authenticate Request - Post Aunthenticate - Authorize Authenticate and so on ... until it gets to Http Handler
which reverses the process and stops at End Request.

Dependency Injection
One of the solid principle. Implemented using IHello interface and Hello concrete class.
Mapped them in the services configurationservice method of the start up class.

Worked with IApplicationBuilder to configure different pipelines and how they should be executed.

Served static files by adding a folder for vscode called wwwroot and created index.html in it.
Added logger ability by injecting it into the configure method and pass in the type startup class.

Routing

This refers to mapping of resource on the server disk.
We use the route attribute in the controllers like this [Route("")] or pass it on the controller level.
Custome Routing

[Route("admin/[controller]/[action]")]
public string Index()
{
    return "Hello User"; 
}

or 

app.UseMvc(routes => {
routes.MapRoute("default", "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}"); 
routes.MapRoute("shop", "shop/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}"); 
});
